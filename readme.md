# Node Waypoints for Black Desert Online

**Please Note:**
This repository is meant to fine-tune my auto-generation of preview images as well as blob/waypoint generation.
It is not neccessarily intended to give the best waypoints for each region/node.
(not that those are really needed :D)

As another side-note:
`All Y positions are set to 0!`

If you are interested in fishing waypoints check out my other repository [Here](https://github.com/Flockenberger/bdo-fish-waypoints)
